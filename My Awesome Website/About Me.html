		<h2>Background About Myself:</h2>
			<article><p>Hi! My name is Jason, I am a recent San Francisco transplant originally from LA!  I studied history at UCLA, and after undergrad I moved to Washington DC where I worked for Congress for almost two years.  (Click <a href="resume.html">Here</a> to view my resume.) However, I knew my true passion was in innovation and technology, so I had to move out here!</p>

		<h2>Why I would be a great programmer:</h2>
			<article><p>I think I will be a good programmer because I am a quick learner, work well in teams, very driven and super meticulous about details.  But moreover, I believe that I will be a good programmer because I have the passion! I had so much fun just making this example website- I can't imagine how rewarding it will be to actually build my own app or anything else!</p></article>
		<h2>What I want to do after the course:</h2>
			<article><p>After the course, I want to jump straight into programming of course! I want to immerse myself in the startup and tech culture as much as possible, and just learn as much as I can.  But moreover, I want to learn how people bring their visions to life- because even if I have an idea right now, I have no idea of how to actualize it.Therefore that is why I want to be a developer: I want the tools to be able to share my dreams and vision with the world, and hopefully solve some problem and change the world in my own way. </p></article>
